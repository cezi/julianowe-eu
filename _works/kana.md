# Design process
description2:
  title: Every trip starts with a plan
  text1: "01 Take off<br />
02 On-board<br />
03 The journey<br />
04 Coming home</p>"

  text2: "<p></br></p>"

# Research
description3:
  title: Taking off
  text1: "<p>There are many reasons for why people travel, most of them revolve around leisure and getting refreshed after long weeks of work or school. Good vacations should cater to our needs, so not a single worry occupies our minds.
</br></br></p>"
  text2: "<p>To get a good understanding of frequent travelers' needs our team developed a screener accompanied by a scripted questionnaire. The questions involved preferences in <b>travel modes, past travel experiences, trip organization, assessments of travel agent services, and the overall experience of purchasing a tour.</b></br></br>
We conducted face to face interviews with five individuals.
</p>"

  title: Everything, everywhere, all at once
  text1: "<p>The results of interviews made us conclude the most important problem and hypothesis.</br></br>
<b>Problem</b>: Planning many trips is time consuming and troublesome.</br></br>
<b>Hypothesis</b>: The process of booking a trip is too long and complicated.</br></br>
<b>Goal</b>: Creating easy and personalized search engine for holiday booking.

</p>"
  text2: "<p>From the interviews we were able to identify the persona and their overarching needs.</br>
Our primary client was <b>a middle-aged woman, a frequent traveler for leisure and business, who needed a tool to help her purchase multiple tours in one.</b></p>"

# Ideation
description5:
  title: On-board
  text1: "<p>All hands on-board, our ideation process started with coming up of a short story where our persona finds BookPlan and tries to give it a try by booking her future vacations. The key part of the story was all about focus on touchpoints of our brand and better connection to the future users. </p>"

  title: Small turbulences
  text1: "<p></p>"
  text2: "<p>To enrich the experience our next crucial step was to establish a User Journey Path. </br></br>
Within this path, we carefully considered potential issues that might be encountered during the trips. We devised swift and effective solutions to ensure that following the initial interaction with BookPlan, users remain encouraged and inclined to return for their future needs.</p>"

# Testing
description7:
  title: Ideas
  text1: "<p>When we began to gather ideas over how might we help in having more control over finances we found many new, interesting ideas that would not only create solutions for the analytics of incomes and expenses in the application but also develop the educational and supportive side of it. </p>"
  text2: "<p> In help came competitor analysis. Our team researched seven applications whose main function was to control and analyze expenses.</br> We identified few the most important and useful ideas which help user stay on track such as: </br></br>
<b>Gamification</b></br>
<b>Setting targets for specific categories</b></br>
<b>Filtering reports by periods</b></br>
<b>Clear and easy to understand graphs of finances and timelines</b>
</p>"

  title: Three branches
  text1: "<p>The time for sketches began. </br>Our team divided work into three key branches of solutions for the user. With that we created the main user flow, including registration, configuration and entry of basic parameters and most importantly, three main paths as means to provide a broad horizon for the user in strengthening his knowledge and control over finances:
</p>"
  text2: "<p><b>Browsing the learning tab,</b></br>
<b>Arranging a consultation with a financial adviser</b></br>
<b>Creating a goal</b></br>
</p>"

# Design
description9:
  title: Trying out
  text1: "<p>To test out our idea each of us in the team created separate wireframes for the three main functionalities: browsing through education tab, making an appointment with financial consultant and creating a goal.</br></br>
I was responsible for preparing the last one.
</p>"
  text2: "<p><b>The first test</b></br>
With the first test performed tested on 5 people. </br> Their task was to:</br></br> <b>1. Make an appointment with a financial consultant</br></br> 2. Browse the knowledge tab and take a quiz </br></br> 3. Create a saving up goal.</b></br></br> During the test many issues emerged that were not clear to the users, they gave us many ideas and solutions. Many of these were duplicated and gave us ideas for improvements.
</p>"

# Design2
description10:
  title: A room for an improvement
  text1: "<p></p>"
  text2: "<p><b>The improvements made were re-tested with 5 respondents. After the second round of testing, we prepared a short list of suggested changes, including the addition of personalised advice and the creation of a new slider when creating a saving target and setting its time.
</p>"
