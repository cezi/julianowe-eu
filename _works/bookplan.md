  title: Taking off
  text1: "<p>There are many reasons for why people travel, most of them revolve around leisure and getting refreshed after long weeks of work or school. Good vacations should cater to our needs, so not a single worry occupies our minds.
</p>"
  text2: "<p>To get a good understanding of frequent travelers' needs our team developed a screener accompanied by a scripted questionnaire. The questions involved preferences in <b>travel modes, past travel experiences, trip organization, assessments of travel agent services, and the overall experience of purchasing a tour.</b></br></br>
We conducted face to face interviews with five individuals.

  text1: "<p>The results of interviews made us conclude the most important problem and hypothesis.</br></br>
<b>Problem</b>: Planning many trips is time consuming and troublesome.</br></br>
<b>Hypothesis</b>: The process of booking a trip is too long and complicated.</br></br>
<b>Goal</b>: Creating easy and personalized search engine for holiday booking.
</p>"
  text2: "<p>From the interviews we were able to identify the persona and their overarching needs.</br>
Our primary client was <b>a middle-aged woman, a frequent traveler for leisure and business, who needed a tool to help her purchase multiple tours in one.</b></p>"

Within this path, we carefully considered <b>potential issues that might be encountered during the trips</b>. We devised swift and effective solutions to ensure that following the initial interaction with BookPlan, users remain encouraged and inclined to return for their future needs.</p>"

  text2: "<p>Throughout the ideation phase, we placed significant emphasis on competition analysis, given the extensive and well-established solutions within the travel agency industry. Drawing inspiration from proven strategies was a key focus.
In my role, I concentrated on analyzing <b>two out of six agencies</b>, namely ITAKA and TUI. Our team also thoroughly reviewed and examined the remaining competitors: Booking.com , Wakacje.pl, Airbnb, and Skyscanner.
The range of products provided encompassed a diverse selection, including tours, hotels, combined flight offers with accommodations, and various amenities.</p>"

Each participant contributed their ideas by jotting them down on slips of paper, followed by a collaborative voting process to identify the most promising concepts.</p>"
  text2: "<p>Some of the ideas under consideration included:</br><br>
• Categories broken down by need</br>
• App prompts for optimal offers</br>
• The ability to change flights and hotel after purchase</br>
• An offer generator based on a pre-filled preference form</br>
• Planning multiple trips at once in one place</br>
• Combining payments for a service

  title: The journey
  text1: "<p>When we moved on to the modeling stage, we created paper prototypes thus testing three people whose task was to:</br></br>
<b>01. Book flight and hotel from Gdańsk to Rome</br>
02. Book flight and hotel from Rome to London</br>
03. Book flight home to Gdańsk</b></br></br>
Our aim was to see <b>if the path to buying more than one trip was easy, short and understandable</b>.
</p>"
  text2: "<p>During testing, it became evident that participants weren't the only ones facing challenges in finding a way to book more than one tour. As testers, we encountered momentary difficulties in completing the test with our paper prototypes. </br></br> This experience guided us to further insights and resolutions.</br></br>
The booking path turned out to be illogical, our participants were forgetting their original choices when booking a second flight. For subsequent tests, <b>we decided to run separate tests using low fidelity prototypes on a web browser resolution</b>, which allows the  better access to process information.</p>"

Challenges emerged when adding a second trip to London.</br> <b>The Add Destination button wasn't visible enough</b>, leading to insights for improvement.
<b>Tab navigation caused confusion</b>, with one person inadvertently returning to the Hotels tab after selecting Flights + Hotels. Despite these challenges, testers successfully booked flights and hotels to Rome and London, with minor confusion during the return flight booking.</p>"
  text2: "<p>In the third round of usability testing, two additional participants were included, leading to valuable insights for refinement and enhancement.</p>"

Additionally, there is room for enhancement in the <b>filter section</b>, with consideration for increasing their number. Introducing a user profile with tabs for various tour types and customized preferences for each category would further elevate the user experience.</p>"
