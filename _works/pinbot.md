# Design process
description2:
  title: The beginnings 
  text1: "<p>My client offers services dealing with SEO, i.e. the optimisation of pages taking into account the search components of Google's web browser. Its services include various activities for improving and managing the Google My Company profile. </p>"

  text2: "<p>During our first meeting, I found out how the world of SEO works and what the market situation is in the city where the client works. He is a freelancer with several local businesses offering gastronomic, hospitality and general services. Many of his clients were unaware of the importance of positioning their business. His main aim was to show his offering helping local businesses to reach more customers.</br></p>"

# Research
description3:
  title: What is SEO?
  text1: "<p>Desk research </br></br>
When looking for new services or checking out a company, people usually use several sources, both online and offline. One of the most common and trusted ways is to use Google's search engine. The website offers and is constantly improving the Google My Business tool, which plays a significant role in SEO by providing current information about a company, showcasing services, location on a map and managing reviews, among other things. As many as 50% of customers trust online reviews as much as referrals from loved ones, and 81% of them read reviews on Google.</p>"
  text2: "<p>After consultation and desk-research, a hypothesis was hatched that not many small business entrepreneurs know of the existence of SEO let alone its importance. </br></br><b>Hypothesis</b>: Local businesses do not know what SEO is and how it affects their business</br></br>
<b>Aim</b>: To create a website that reaches out to customers and offers them solutions for better visibility in Google search.</p>"

description4:
  title: Competition analysis
  text1: "<p>During my research, I relied on a national and global competitive analysis, including both large companies offering many solutions beyond SEO and smaller national businesses. The analysis included Whitespark, Brightlocal, Zgred, Visible and Localiq.
Each company was examined against client guidelines, which can be seen in the graphic below</p>"
  text2: "<p>Through the analysis we drew inspiration and ideas for our product, including:</br></br>
FAQ section at the end of the page</br>
Free audit option with good explanation what it is and what benefits it gives</br>
Pricing options but considering personalised pricing after consultation</br>
Education resources (articles, blog)</br>
Chatbox</br>
Link generator</br>
Price converter</p>"

# Ideation
description5:
  title: Customer Journey Map
  text1: "<p>After gathering SEO tips and knowledge, I moved on to building a Customer Journey Map based on client collaboration and customer experience. The most important thing at this stage was to establish touch points and encourage the client to take advantage of a free audit of their business so that they would consider further collaboration and convert one of Pinbot's offers.

  title: Ideation
  text1: "<p></p>"
  text2: "<p>It was very important to prepare an easy and non invasive way to encourage the user to try the new solution for balancing his finances.</br></br> In a User Journey Map our team envisaged a path of app download, setup, use and loyalty. We tried to find the points at which something could go wrong and find optimal solutions such as minimising user control and being able to individualize information in terms of user preferences.</p>"

# Testing
description7:
  title: Ideas
  text1: "<p>Brain storming</br></br>In the ideation process, we focused on the structure of the site and content through brainstorming. We developed the idea of a free audit in preparation for further delineating the path of the process, developed FAQs for the subpages and cut down on the idea of effectively showing the offer in an understandable and accessible way.
In addition, we tackled the marketing side by developing initial ideas for customer loyalty.
</p>"
  text2: "<p>User Flow</br></br>
To get a good idea of the layout of the page and the positioning of the most important elements, I created a User Flow, which can be found below.  It contains the general layout of the page, detailing the free audit trail.</p>"

  title: Wireframes
  text1: "<p>The time for sketches began. </br>Our team divided work into three key branches of solutions for the user. With that we created the main user flow, including registration, configuration and entry of basic parameters and most importantly, three main paths as means to provide a broad horizon for the user in strengthening his knowledge and control over finances:
</p>"
  text2: "<p><b>Browsing the learning tab,</b></br>
<b>Arranging a consultation with a financial adviser</b></br>
<b>Creating a goal</b></br>
</p>"

# Design
description9:
  title: Tests
  text1: "<p>To test out our idea each of us in the team created separate wireframes for the three main functionalities: browsing through education tab, making an appointment with financial consultant and creating a goal.</br></br>
I was responsible for preparing the last one.
</p>"
  text2: "<p><b>The first test</b></br>
With the first test performed tested on 5 people. </br> Their task was to:</br></br> <b>1. Make an appointment with a financial consultant</br></br> 2. Browse the knowledge tab and take a quiz </br></br> 3. Create a saving up goal.</b></br></br> During the test many issues emerged that were not clear to the users, they gave us many ideas and solutions. Many of these were duplicated and gave us ideas for improvements.
</p>"

# Design2

  title: A room for an improvement
  text1: "<p></p>"
  text2: "<p><b>The improvements made were re-tested with 5 respondents. After the second round of testing, we prepared a short list of suggested changes, including the addition of personalised advice and the creation of a new slider when creating a saving target and setting its time.
