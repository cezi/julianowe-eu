# Design process
description2:
  title: First, the plan
  text1: "01 Dive in<br />
02 Ideas<br />
03 Tests<br />
04 Design</p>"

  text2: "<p>People find it difficult to manage their finances for various reasons. </br> Many of them arise from the fact that it’s a time-consuming process and pretty monotonous. </br> Not everyone wants to sit down quietly every month and write down all expenses and incomes in an Excel sheet table. </br></p>"

# Time is one thing, but understanding
description3:
  title: Time is one thing, but understanding
  text1: "<p>From our interviews and a review of money saving and tracking applications, we concluded that people don’t know where to get knowledge from when it comes to better understanding of their finances. </br></br> The applications we analyzed didn’t offer user support, nor did they provide education on this topic. </br></br>This led us to form the basis of our hypothesis.
</p>"
  text2: "<p> <b>Problem</b>: Lack of external and personalized support from financial applications</br></br>
<b>Hypothesis</b>: People want to improve their money management skills and understand money management better.</br></br>
<b>Goal</b>: Build an app that helps meet goals and improve the financial management process while educating the user.
</p>"

  title: Missed opportunities
  text1: "<p>Interviews helped us receive a broader picture on how daily management of finances looks like.</br> Our main goal was to understand what problems were encountered, what influenced the daily choices and what would help us be more content with our budget.</br></br> The response was strikingly similar from a person to a person. </br> Results of the interviews showed that main cause of dissatisfaction were:</br></br>
<b>- Difficulty in planning the expenses</br></br>
- Lack of knowledge of finances</br></br>
- Problems with saving up for long term goals</br></br>
- Unpredictability in expenses</br></br>
- Guilty pleasures</b>

# Two approaches, one goal
description5:
  title: Two approaches, one goal
  text1: "<p> </p>"
  text2: "<p>In the conducted eight interviews, we identified two main personas.</br></br>
01. The first persona has a <b>stable financial situation</b> and is interested in <b>optimizing their budget management.</b></br></br>
02. The second persona is a young person who has <b>recently started earning money and has little financial awareness or discipline</b>. However, they are willing to save money regularly.

  title: Predicting the next step
  text1: "<p>It was very important to prepare an easy and non invasive way to encourage the user to try the new solution for balancing his finances.</br></br> In a User Journey Map our team envisaged a path of app download, setup, use and loyalty. We tried to find the points at which something could go wrong and find optimal solutions such as minimising user control and being able to individualize information in terms of user preferences.</p>"

# Ideas
description7:
  title: Ideas
  text1: "<p>When we began to gather ideas over how might we help in having more control over finances we found many new, interesting ideas that would not only create solutions for the analytics of incomes and expenses in the application but also develop the educational and supportive side of it. </p>"
  text2: "<p> In help came competitor analysis. Our team researched seven applications whose main function was to control and analyze expenses.</br> We identified few the most important and useful ideas which help user stay on track such as: </br></br>
<b>Gamification</b></br>
<b>Setting targets for specific categories</b></br>
<b>Filtering reports by periods</b></br>
<b>Clear and easy to understand graphs of finances and timelines</b>

# Three branches
description8:
  title: Three branches
  text1: "<p>The time for sketches began. </br>Our team divided work into three key branches of solutions for the user. With that we created the main user flow, including registration, configuration and entry of basic parameters and most importantly, three main paths as means to provide a broad horizon for the user in strengthening his knowledge and control over finances:
</p>"
  text2: "<p><b>Browsing the learning tab,</b></br>
<b>Arranging a consultation with a financial adviser</b></br>
<b>Creating a goal</b></br>

# Trying out
description9:
  title: Trying out
  text1: "<p>To test out our idea each of us in the team created separate wireframes for the three main functionalities: browsing through education tab, making an appointment with financial consultant and creating a goal.</br></br>
I was responsible for preparing the last one.
</p>"
  text2: "<p><b>The first test</b></br>
With the first test performed tested on 5 people. </br> Their task was to:</br></br> <b>1. Make an appointment with a financial consultant</br></br> 2. Browse the knowledge tab and take a quiz </br></br> 3. Create a saving up goal.</b></br></br> During the test many issues emerged that were not clear to the users, they gave us many ideas and solutions. Many of these were duplicated and gave us ideas for improvements.
