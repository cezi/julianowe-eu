  text2: "<p>People find it difficult to manage their finances for various reasons. </br> Many of them arise from the fact that it’s a time-consuming process and pretty monotonous. </br> Not everyone wants to sit down quietly every month and write down all expenses and incomes in an Excel sheet table. </br></p>"

# Research
description3:
  title: Time is one thing, but understanding
  text1: "<p>From our interviews and a review of money saving and tracking applications, we concluded that people don’t know where to get knowledge from when it comes to better understanding of their finances. </br></br> The applications we analyzed didn’t offer user support, nor did they provide education on this topic. </br></br>This led us to form the basis of our hypothesis.
</p>"
  text2: "<p> <b>Problem</b>: Lack of external and personalized support from financial applications</br></br>
<b>Hypothesis</b>: People want to improve their money management skills and understand money management better.</br></br>
<b>Goal</b>: Build an app that helps meet goals and improve the financial management process while educating the user.
